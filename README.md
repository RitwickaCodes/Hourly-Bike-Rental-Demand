# Hourly Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## Overview
This project is used to predict the hourly bike rental demand based on various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and more. This project showcases my ability to apply data science principles, from data preprocessing to model deployment, in solving real-world problems.

## Project Structure

- **Benchmark solution.ipynb**: A comprehensive Jupyter notebook detailing the end-to-end process of data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.
- **Problem Statement.pdf**: The problem statement guiding the project's objectives and goals.
- **solution_checker.xlsx**: A utility for validating the model's predictions against expected results.
- **test.csv**: The test dataset used for generating predictions.
- **train.csv**: The training dataset used to build the predictive model.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Preprocessing**: Proficient in handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling data for optimal model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Expertise in using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to uncover insights and visualize data trends.
- **Modeling**: Competence in building and fine-tuning regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Applied evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to assess and improve model accuracy.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hourly-Bike-Rental-Demand.git
   ```
2. **Install the required libraries**:
   Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - scikit-learn

   You can install them using:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. **Run the Notebook**:
   Open `Benchmark solution.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to see the analysis and model in action.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

- Building robust data pipelines.
- Developing predictive models that can be deployed in real-world scenarios.
- Applying statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance model performance.
- Communicating data-driven insights through well-documented code and visualizations.
